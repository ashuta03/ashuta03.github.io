## About me

I am a Computer Science PhD student at the University of Delaware. I work with Dr. Chandra Kambhamettu in [Video/Image Modelling and Synthesis (VIMS)](http://bigdatavision.org/) lab. 


## Research

Recent studies in deep learning-based contour detection methods show high accuracy in single class boundary or edge detection problems. However, this performance does not translate well in a multi-class contour detection scenario where continuous contours are required. My current research focuses on developing an efficient deep learning-based solution to multi-class contour detection problem. This system can be applied in medical image segmentation and diagnostic studies. 

My research interest includes **Deep learning, Image classificationa and segmentation, Medical image analysis, and VR technology**.
