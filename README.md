## About me
<p style="text-align: justify;">
I am a Computer Science Ph.D. candidate at the University of Delaware, specializing in computer vision and deep learning, with a strong focus on video processing and biomedical image analysis. I am experienced in leading research projects, building machine learning models, and publishing in top conferences. I am currently seeking a research-driven role to leverage my expertise in machine learning and deep learning for impactful innovations.

<!-- I am a Computer Science PhD student at the University of Delaware. I work with Dr. Chandra Kambhamettu in <a href="http://bigdatavision.org/">Video/Image Modelling and Synthesis (VIMS)</a> lab. -->

## Research
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<!-- Recent studies in deep learning-based contour detection methods show high accuracy in single class boundary or edge detection problems. However, this performance does not translate well in a multi-class contour detection scenario where continuous contours are required. My current research focuses on developing an efficient deep learning-based solution to multi-class contour detection problem. This system can be applied in medical image segmentation and diagnostic studies. <a href="http://bigdatavision.org/octimg/">More</a> -->
I lead cutting-edge research in computer vision and biomedical image analysis under Dr. Chandra Kambhamettu at the <a href="http://bigdatavision.org/">Video/Image Modelling and Synthesis (VIMS)</a> lab. Some of my research projects include activity recognition, retinal disease detection, VR simulation, small object counting, and forensic signature recognition. I have also applied deep learning to real-world problems, such as sickle-cell retinopathy detection from OCT images and automatic biomedical document classification. You can learn more about my research in OCT images and sickle-cell retinopathy <a href="https://bigdatavision.org/OCT/index.html">here</a>.
